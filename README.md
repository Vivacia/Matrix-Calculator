# Matrix-Calculator
A program which can perform the basic arithmetic operations on a matrix, take its transpose and calculate its inverse. In addition to this, it stores the history of operations performed. This was my final project for CS in gr12.

Operations that can be performed:
<ul>
<li>Addition</li>
<li>Subtraction</li>
<li>Multiplication</li>
<li>Transpose</li>
<li>Invert the matrix</li>
<li>Store/clear history</li>
</ul>
